scheck
--------------------

Spell checker for journal submissions (tutorial exercise,
see here: http://latedev.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/writing-a-real-c-program-index/)

Requirements:
-------------

 Plain ASCII submissions
 Check each submission for spelling mistakes
 Output number of errors and print the errors in context
 Alongside standard English dictionary also support multiple technical dictionaries for specialist terms

Aim to produce console program with command line operation like:
scheck [-n] [[-d special.dict] …] [file …]

where -n prints only the number of errors and -d specifies a special dictionary.

Sample Output:
article1.txt,2 errors
article1.text,7,thre,perhaps thre is a reaction
article1.text,12,phiton,low-energy phiton is emitted

Could add XML output later, but first aim for comma seperated variables as above.

Checking a document should not take more than 2-3x as long as listing it on the screen.
